# Algorithms and datastructures
My exam in algorithms and datastructures is on the 12th of December (29th of November when writing this). Come with me on my journey to study the subject and prepare as well as I can.

## Gameplan
My plan for the following 12 days is to study notes from the subject and make sure I have a decent understanding of all topics. I will post my notes here daily, to keep myself accountable (and for my friends to see my notes hehe). Depending on the amount of time I have, I will perform exercises to understand the concepts better, and possibly post my solutions here. Towards the end of my study period I will be going through previous exams to get familiar with the exam format.

I am also planning on having a seperate section for all algorithms in our curriculum. Here I will include its spesific usecase, pseudocode or explanation of how it works and the runtime, as well as other information I might find useful. My notes will either be in Norwegian or English, depending on my mood when I am writing them or the material I am taking notes from. Expect some humor or frustrated comments, as I believe this will be an emotional rollercoaster. I hope you enjoy my notes (or cry with me as I work with it), and that we can get the best possible understanding of algorithms and datastructures. 

## Good takeaways
I learned a lot about the sorting algorithm from trying to sort cards according to the pseudocode. Highly recommend!

## Shoutouts
Here I will post the people who has particularly helped me, and links to their work if applicable and/or if I get their permission to.

First shoutout goes to an anonymous hero for writing a great compendium. I am basing most of my Norwegian notes on their compendium, and have been allowed to post my notes. Contact me if you want the compendium, at hanlun0804@outlook.com.
